# Usage
## Installation
In order to install `html5-pong` on your website you have to simply add the script file to your page. Please feel free to use the CDN version like in the example below.

```JavaScript
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://rawgit.com/SMenigat/html5-pong/master/pong.js" />
```

## Setting up a game
To initialize a game you got to have at least one **canvas** nodes in your HTML body. The size or dimensions of the **canvas** nodes do not matter, the script turns everything into a game - enjoyable or not. The **canvas** node needs to have an **id** attribute set! This is needed for the further initialization.

Take a look at the following example to get an idea on how to initialize a game.

```JavaScript
<canvas id="gameCanvas" width="800" height="600" tabindex="1"></canvas>
<script>
    // initialize the game, giving it the id of the canvas we want to transform
    var Game = new PongGame('gameCanvas');
    
    // run the game with some options
    Game.run({
        difficulty: PongGame.aiDifficulty.easy,
        names: {
            Player1: 'PongPlayer'
        }
    });
</script>
```

## Options
Below you can take a look at the default configuration of the game.

```JavaScript
{
  isMultiplayer: false,
  // available difficulty values: easy, normal, hard
  difficulty: PongGame.aiDifficulty.normal, 
  finalScore: 5,
  names: {
      Player1: 'Player1',  
      Player2: 'Player2'  
  },
  // available color values: any hex color code or css color name
  colors: {
      background: 'black',
      bat: 'green',
      ball: 'white',
      scores: 'red'
  },
  controls: {
      Player1: {
          up: 'w',
          down: 's'
      },
      Player2: {
          up: 'o',
          down: 'l'
      }
  }
}
```

These default values can be overwritten by a custom configuration object, handed in at `PongGame.run()` like in the example before. 

Additionally you could also use `PongGame.setConfiguration()` to change some configuration dynamicly:

```JavaScript
<script>
    // all of a sudden, our PongPlayer wants to be called "SuperPongPlayer"
    Game.setConfiguration({
      names: {
        Player1: 'SuperPongPlayer'
      }
    });
</script>
```

## Additional methods
There are some more methods available that you can use. Just have a look.

```JavaScript
<script>
    /*
      pausing the game. 
      this is done automaticly if the game canvas looses focus.
    */
    Game.pause();
    
    /*
      resuming the game.
    */
    Game.resume();
    
    /*
      changing the difficulty. 
      in this example to the unbeatable hardmode.
    */
    Game.setDifficulty(PongGame.aiDifficulty.hard);
    
    // this is equal to:
    Game.setConfiguration({
      difficulty: PongGame.aiDifficulty.hard
    });
    
    /*
      toggling multiplayer. 
      in this example, we are enabling it (it's disabled per default)
    */
    Game.setMultiplayer(true);
    
    // this is equal to:
    Game.setConfiguration({
      isMultiplayer: true
    });
</script>
```
